## VIEWER COLUMNS vs PURE COLUMNS ##

on stars with more than one major strat differential, it's common to have
 strat combinations which while in principle are possible, rarely occur in
 practice. ex: front sub w/ chip clip, bits leftside tjwk w/ manamo.


## SPECIAL STARS ##

most strats with alt timings (moving reds, wdw mid entry, etc) can be compared
 easily, therefore, we simply add a permanent offset.

red coin star/pipe xcams can be compared relatively straightforwardly,
 as can most cutscene/no cutscene times. for these we want to have an offset, but
 with the option to only view one at a time.

with penguin + jrb pillar US/JP, they can still be compared, but the value of such
 a comparison is dubious at best. ultimately, while this is a very strange case,
 we dont really need to change anything to deal with it
