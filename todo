
STAR ORG
* fix that one star in ttc/rr.... you know the one where the variant is completely mislabelled?
* fix ssl bird variants being mislabelled

REFACTORING
* refactor playdb / how player data is sent to the star cell area

DAILY STAR GENERATOR
* test "multi-glob" stars

FRONTEND
-- mobile viewer

BACKEND
-- functionality for if i have to shut off the backend
-- automatic backups
-- better server-side validation
-- auto-commit to the xcam cache

TSC STUFF
-- properly deal with typescript w/ firebase, json, etc

NICKNAME EDIT
-- better nickname validator

STRAT-VIEW RELATED BUGS
* remove JP/US toggle from BBH text skip
* figure out how row stuff works when JP/US is toggled
* disable columns when switching between view/edit + when user auth changes
-- custom variants (for open strats)

-- variant toggler (?)

* extension/open strats
-- fix the canonical sorting, probably caused bc merge view (jrb blast / ttc 100c examples)
-- banned/official columns (bits)
-- ss IGT record

* deal with "special stars"
-- lil penguin
-- sl cannon
-- wdw arrow lifts

MONTY BUGS

## VIEWER COLUMNS vs PURE COLUMNS ##

on stars with more than one major strat differential, it's common to have
 strat combinations which while in principle are possible, rarely occur in
 practice. ex: front sub w/ chip clip, bits leftside tjwk w/ manamo.


## SPECIAL STARS ##

most strats with alt timings (moving reds, wdw mid entry, etc) can be compared
 easily, therefore, we simply add a permanent offset.

red coin star/pipe xcams can be compared relatively straightforwardly,
 as can most cutscene/no cutscene times. for these we want to have an offset, but
 with the option to only view one at a time.

with penguin + jrb pillar US/JP, they can still be compared, but the value of such
 a comparison is dubious at best. ultimately, while this is a very strange case,
 we dont really need to change anything to deal with it

----------------------------

main column names
- all disjoint / vary across the same movement strat
- open column ALWAYS exists unless the xcam is the same as the SS strat
- for more obscure strats, the goal is competition.
  they are given unique columns if they:
  - see substantial use at multiple skill levels
  - afford enough timesave that they would be used at lower skill levels
   if they were easier

obscure columns (demoted to open variants)
- CCM 100C + Slide: Blue Coin Switch Route
- CCM 100C + Slide: No Teleporter Route
- CCM 100C + Race: Blue Coin Switch Route
- CCM 100C + Race: No Teleporter Route
- Whirl: Double Slide
- SL 100C + Reds: Alt Route
- Koopa Rematch: Mountain Clip

special exception to avoid cluttering variant list
- Owlless: Sideflip

salt flip JP: 47.23
salt flp star: 42.33
raw diff: 4.90
frame diff: 147

fs reds JP: 1:00.03
fs reds star: 51.63
raw diff: 8.40
frame diff: 252

sky reds JP: 1:07.70
sky reds star: 1:02.30

  ## main info
name: string
id: string
100c?: boolean

  ## version info
def?: "jp" | "us" | null | "offset" | "spec"
offset?: int | { string => int }

  ## variant + strat info
variants?: [string]
var_groups?: [[string, "{int}", ...]]
beg?: [string]
rows: [
  ["JP" | "US" | "second" | "misc" | "rt" |
    "easy" | "hard" | "alt:{int}" | string]
]
ext?: [ ... ]
open: [string] | null


- we need short codes to display for the main star + its alts
- we need category info for the main star + its alts
- we need to know the relationship between the main + alt
 (how does the offset work)

info: ["only:120" | "only:70" | "only:120beg" | "only:70beg" |
  "in:16" | "in:16no" | "only:16" | "notin:120" | "only:any" |
  "only:beg" | "main:{string}" | string],
alt?: {
  status: "cutscene" | "diff" | "offset" | "softOffset", 
  offset?: int,
  info: ["KtQ (NC)", "only:120"],
}


info/alt needs enough information to distinguish major secondary strats,
 both informationally, and functionally. the main use cases are:
- short codes for displaying star scores [visual]
- major strat names for viewer toggle [visual]
- a method for merging major strats when relevant [functional]
